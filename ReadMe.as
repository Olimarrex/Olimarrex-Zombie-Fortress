I (Vamist) just attempted to fix this mod. 
I fixed the not able to load, red circles and out of date Runner scripts.
If there is any bugs contact the mod owner (Frikman) or contact me (vamist) if he's not arround.

Update:
Contact (Olimarrex) on discord first.
I am slowly removing backwards compatibility, and bringing everything up to date, I am changing the way everything is worked, since it currently works like b a d.
Also adding in a bunch of my own stuff because I want to.
Enjoy?
